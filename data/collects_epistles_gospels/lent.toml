JESUS was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to

of him a sign from heaven. But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto

against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I 
cast out devils through Beelzebub. And if I by Beelzebub cast out

he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his

more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the

WHEN the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the 
people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: And when they 
had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate 
the governor. Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he 
was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces 
of silver to the chief priests and elders, Saying, I have sinned in 
that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that 
to us? see thou to that. And he cast down the pieces of silver in the 
temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. And the chief 
priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put 
them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they 
took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury 
strangers in. Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, 
unto this day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the 
prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price 
of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did 
value; And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed 
me. And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, 
saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou 
sayest. And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he 
answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how 
many things they witness against thee? And he answered him to never a 
word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. Now at that feast 
the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom 
they would. And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. 
Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, 
Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is 
called Christ? For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. When 
he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, 
Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many 
things this day in a dream because of him. But the chief priests and 
elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and 
destroy Jesus. The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of 
the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. 
Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is 
called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. And the 
governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the 
more, saying, Let him be crucified. When Pilate saw that he could 
prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, 
and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of 
the blood of this just person: see ye to it. Then answered all the 
people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. Then 
released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he 
delivered him to be crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor took 
Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of 
soldiers. And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. And 
when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, 
and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and 
mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they spit upon him, 
and took the reed, and smote him on the head. And after that they had 
mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment 
on him, and led him away to crucify him. And as they came out, they 
found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his 
cross. And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is 
to say, a place of a skull, They gave him vinegar to drink mingled 
with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. And 
they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it 
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my 
garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. And 
sitting down they watched him there; And set up over his head his 
accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then were 
there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and 
another on the left. And they that passed by reviled him, wagging 
their heads, And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and 
buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, 
come down from the cross. Likewise also the chief priests mocking 
him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he 
cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from 
the cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God; let him 
deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of 
God. The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same 
in his teeth. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the 
land unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a 
loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My 
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood 
there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. And 
straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with 
vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. The rest said, 
Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. Jesus, when 
he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, 
behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the 
bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; And the graves 
were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, And 
came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy 
city, and appeared unto many. Now when the centurion, and they that 
were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things 
that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son

say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me. And 
they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? 
and another said, Is it I? And he answered and said unto them, It is 
one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish. The Son of man 
indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom 
the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never 
been born. And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and 
brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. And 
he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: 
and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my blood of 
the new testament, which is shed for many. Verily I say unto you, I 
will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I 
drink it new in the kingdom of God. And when they had sung an hymn, 
they went out into the mount of Olives. And Jesus saith unto them, 
All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, 
I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. But 
after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. But Peter 
said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I. And 
Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in 
this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will 
not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all. And they came 
to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, 
Sit ye here, while I shall pray. And he taketh with him Peter and 
James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; 
And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry 
ye here, and watch. And he went forward a little, and fell on the 
ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass 
from him. And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto 
thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but 
what thou wilt. And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith 
unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? 
Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is 
ready, but the flesh is weak. And again he went away, and prayed, and 
spake the same words. And when he returned, he found them asleep 
again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer 
him. And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, 
and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son 
of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise up, let us go; lo, 
he that betrayeth me is at hand. And immediately, while he yet spake, 
cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with 
swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the 
elders. And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, 
Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away 
safely. And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and 
saith, Master, master; and kissed him. And they laid their hands on 
him, and took him. And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and 
smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear. And Jesus 
answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, 
with swords and with staves to take me? I was daily with you in the 
temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be 
fulfilled. And they all forsook him, and fled. And there followed him 
a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; 
and the young men laid hold on him: And he left the linen cloth, and 
fled from them naked. And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and 
with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the 
scribes. And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the 
high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the 
fire. And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness 
against Jesus to put him to death; and found none. For many bare 
false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together. And 
there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, We 
heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, 
and within three days I will build another made without hands. But 
neither so did their witness agree together. And the high priest 
stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou 
nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? But he held his 
peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and 
said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? And Jesus 
said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand 
of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest 
rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? Ye 
have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him 
to be guilty of death. And some began to spit on him, and to cover 
his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the 
servants did strike him with the palms of their hands. And as Peter 
was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high 
priest: And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, 
and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. But he denied, 
saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he 
went out into the porch; and the cock crew. And a maid saw him again, 
and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them. And he 
denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to 
Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy 
speech agreeth thereto. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I 
know not this man of whom ye speak. And the second time the cock 
crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, 
Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he 
thought thereon, he wept.

AND straightway in the morning the chief priests held a 
consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and 
bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. And 
Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering 
said unto them, Thou sayest it. And the chief priests accused him of 
many things: but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, 
saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness 
against thee. But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate 
marvelled. Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, 
whomsoever they desired. And there was one named Barabbas, which lay 
bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had 
committed murder in the insurrection. And the multitude crying aloud 
began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. But Pilate 
answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of 
the Jews? For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for 
envy. But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather 
release Barabbas unto them. And Pilate answered and said again unto 
them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the 
King of the Jews? And they cried out again, Crucify him. Then Pilate 
said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the 
more exceedingly, Crucify him. And so Pilate, willing to content the 
people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had 
scourged him, to be crucified. And the soldiers led him away into the 
hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. And 
they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put 
it about his head, And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, 
and bowing their knees worshipped him. And when they had mocked him, 
they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, 
and led him out to crucify him. And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, 
who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and 
Rufus, to bear his cross. And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, 
which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. And they gave him 
to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. And when 
they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon 
them, what every man should take. And it was the third hour, and they 
crucified him. And the superscription of his accusation was written 
over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. And with him they crucify two thieves; 
the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. And the 
scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the 
transgressors. And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their 
heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest 
it in three days, Save thyself, and come down from the cross. 
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with 
the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. Let Christ the 
King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and 
believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. And when 
the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until 
the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, 
saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My 
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And some of them that stood 
by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. And one ran 
and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave 
him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come 
to take him down. And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the 
ghost. And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to 
the bottom. And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw 
that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man 
was the Son of God.

WHERE a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of 
the testator. For a testament is of force after men are dead: 
otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth. 
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. 
For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according 
to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and 
scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the 
people, Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath 
enjoined unto you. Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the 
tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry. And almost all 
things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of 
blood is no remission. It was therefore necessary that the patterns 
of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the 
heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For 
Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are 
the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the 
presence of God for us: Nor yet that he should offer himself often, 
as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood 
of others; For then must he often have suffered since the foundation 
of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared 
to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed 
unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Christ was once 
offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him 
shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

NOW the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the 
Passover. And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might 
kill him; for they feared the people. Then entered Satan into Judas 
surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. And he went his 
way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might 
betray him unto them. And they were glad, and covenanted to give him 
money. And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto 
them in the absence of the multitude. Then came the day of unleavened 
bread, when the passover must be killed. And he sent Peter and John, 
saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat. And they 
said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? And he said unto 
them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man 
meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where 
he entereth in. And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The 
Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat 
the passover with my disciples? And he shall shew you a large upper 
room furnished: there make ready. And they went, and found as he had 
said unto them: and they made ready the passover. And when the hour 
was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. And he said 
unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you 
before I suffer: For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, 
until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. And he took the cup, and 
gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: For 
I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the 
kingdom of God shall come. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and 
brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given 
for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after 
supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is 
shed for you. But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with 
me on the table. And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was 
determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! And they 
began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should 
do this thing. And there was also a strife among them, which of them 
should be accounted the greatest. And he said unto them, The kings of 
the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them; and they that exercise 
authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so: 
but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he 
that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that 
sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? 
but I am among you as he that serveth. Ye are they which have 
continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a 
kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; That ye may eat and 
drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the 
twelve tribes of Israel. And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, 
Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I 
have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art 
converted, strengthen thy brethren. And he said unto him, Lord, I am 
ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. And he said, I 
tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou 
shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. And he said unto them, When I 
sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? 
And they said, Nothing. Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath 
a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no 
sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. For I say unto you, 
that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was 
reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have 
an end. And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said 
unto them, It is enough. And he came out, and went, as he was wont, 
to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. And when 
he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into 
temptation. And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and 
kneeled down, and prayed, Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove 
this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. And 
there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. And 
being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it 
were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. And when he 
rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them 
sleeping for sorrow, And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, 
lest ye enter into temptation. And while he yet spake, behold a 
multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went 
before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. But Jesus said 
unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? When they 
which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, 
shall we smite with the sword? And one of them smote the servant of 
the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And Jesus answered and 
said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. 
Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, 
and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a 
thief, with swords and staves? When I was daily with you in the 
temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your 
hour, and the power of darkness. Then took they him, and led him, and 
brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar 
off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and 
were set down together, Peter sat down among them. But a certain maid 
beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and 
said, This man was also with him. And he denied him, saying, Woman, I 
know him not. And after a little while another saw him, and said, 
Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. And about the 
space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a 
truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. And Peter 
said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet 
spake, the cock crew. And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And 
Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, 
Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And Peter went out, 
and wept bitterly. And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote 
him. And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, 
and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? And many 
other things blasphemously spake they against him. And as soon as it 
was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the 
scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, Art 
thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye 
will not believe: And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor 
let me go. Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of 
the power of God. Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? 
And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. And they said, What need we 
any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.

IN this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come 
together not for the better, but for the worse. For first of all, 
when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions

among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among 
you. When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to

God, and shame them that have not? what shall I say to you? shall I

night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given 
thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is

examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that 
cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh 
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause 
many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would 
judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we 
are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the

THE whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. And 
they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the 
nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he 
himself is Christ a King. And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the 
King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. Then 
said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault 
in this man. And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up 
the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to 
this place. When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man 
were a Galilaean. And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto 
Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at 
Jerusalem at that time. And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding 
glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had 
heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done 
by him. Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered 
him nothing. And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently 
accused him. And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and 
mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to 
Pilate. And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: 
for before they were at enmity between themselves. And Pilate, when 
he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the 
people, Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that 
perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before 
you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye 
accuse him: No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, 
nothing worthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chastise 
him, and release him. (For of necessity he must release one unto them 
at the feast.) And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this 
man, and release unto us Barabbas: (Who for a certain sedition made 
in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) Pilate therefore, 
willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. But they cried, 
saying, Crucify him, crucify him. And he said unto them the third 
time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in 
him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. And they were 
instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And 
the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. And Pilate 
gave sentence that it should be as they required. And he released 
unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom 
they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. And as they 
led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out 
of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it 
after Jesus. And there followed him a great company of people, and of 
women, which also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto 
them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for 
yourselves, and for your children. For, behold, the days are coming, 
in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs 
that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. Then shall they 
begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover 
us. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done 
in the dry? And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him 
to be put to death. And when they were come to the place, which is 
called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on 
the right hand, and the other on the left. Then said Jesus, Father, 
forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his 
raiment, and cast lots. And the people stood beholding. And the 
rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him 
save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. And the soldiers 
also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, And saying, 
If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. And a superscription 
also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, 
THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactors which were 
hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 
But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, 
seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for 
we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done 
nothing amiss. And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou 
comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto 
thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. And it was about the 
sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the 
ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was 
rent in the midst. And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he 
said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said 
thus, he gave up the ghost. Now when the centurion saw what was done, 
he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. And all 
the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things 
which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. And all his 
acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood 
afar off, beholding these things.

THE law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very 
image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they 
offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect. 
For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the 
worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. 
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins 
every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of 
goats should take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, 
he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast 
thou prepared me: In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast 
had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book 
it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God. Above when he said, 
Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou 
wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by 
the law; Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh 
away the first, that he may establish the second. By the which will 
we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ 
once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministering and 
offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away 
sins: But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for 
ever, sat down on the right hand of God; From henceforth expecting 
till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath 
perfected for ever them that are sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost 
also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before, This is 
the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the 
Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I 
write them; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. 
Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin. 
Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the 
blood of Jesus, By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated 
for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; And having an 
high priest over the house of God; Let us draw near with a true heart 
in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil 
conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast 
the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful 
that promised;) And let us consider one another to provoke unto love 
and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves 
together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so 
much the more, as ye see the day approaching.

THEN Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him. And the 
soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they 
put on him a purple robe, And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they 
smote him with their hands. Pilate therefore went forth again, and 
saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know 
that I find no fault in him. Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown 
of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold 
the man! When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they 
cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, 
Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. The Jews 
answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because 
he made himself the Son of God. When Pilate therefore heard that 
saying, he was the more afraid; And went again into the judgment 
hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no 
answer. Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? 
knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to 
release thee? Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all 
against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that 
delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. And from thenceforth 
Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou 
let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh 
himself a king speaketh against Caesar. When Pilate therefore heard 
that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment 
seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, 
Gabbatha. And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the 
sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! But they 
cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith 
unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We 
have no king but Caesar. Then delivered he him therefore unto them to 
be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away. And he bearing 
his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which 
is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: Where they crucified him, and two 
other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. And 
Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was 
JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. This title then read many of 
the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the 
city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. Then said 
the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the 
Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. Pilate answered, What 
I have written I have written. Then the soldiers, when they had 
crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every 
soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, 
woven from the top throughout. They said therefore among themselves, 
Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the 
scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment 
among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things 
therefore the soldiers did. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his 
mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary 
Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple 
standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold 
thy son! Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from 
that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. After this, Jesus 
knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture 
might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full 
of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon 
hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had received 
the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave 
up the ghost. The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, 
that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, 
(for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their 
legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Then came 
the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which 
was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he 
was dead already, they brake not his legs: But one of the soldiers 
with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and 
water. And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he 
knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. For these things 
were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him 
shall not be broken. And again another scripture saith, They shall 
look on him whom they pierced.

IT is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well 
doing, than for evil doing. For Christ also hath once suffered for 
sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being 
put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: By which also 
he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; Which sometime were 
disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of 
Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight 
souls were saved by water. The like figure whereunto even baptism 
doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the 
flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ: Who is gone into heaven, and is on the 
right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made 
subject unto him.

WHEN the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named 
Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: He went to Pilate, and 
begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be 
delivered. And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a 
clean linen cloth, And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn 
out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the 
sepulchre, and departed. And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other 
Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. Now the next day, that 
followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees 
came together unto Pilate, Saying, Sir, we remember that that 
deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise 
again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the 
third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and 
say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error 
shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them, Ye have a 
watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. So they went, and made 
the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.
